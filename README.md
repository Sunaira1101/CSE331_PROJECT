<h1 align="center"><b>Hand Gesture Controlled Robot Car Using Arduino</b></h1>


This project "Hand Gesture Controlled Robot Car Using Arduino" involves developing both hardware and software components to create a robot car that can be controlled via hand gestures. This system employs Arduino for processing the gestures, which are captured and transmitted using specialized hardware. The software aspect includes programming the Arduino and simulating the system using Proteus. This project aims to integrate intuitive gesture control with robotics to enhance user interaction with the robot car.
